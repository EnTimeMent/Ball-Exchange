# Ball-Exchange

In this repository, code of the TCN architecture presented in the paper "The Importance of Multiple Temporal Scales in Motion Recognition: when Shallow Model can Support Deep Multi Scale Models" are reported. 


# Requirements 
The TCN architecture code is based on Python and Pytorch.

The TCN model we proposed is able to handle multiple temporal scales for a variable number of different time series but can easily be extended to handle more.
